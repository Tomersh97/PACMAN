A screen's step file is formatted as follows:
NAME_OF_ENTITY DIRECTION|  		       (Ex: GHOST UP|)
where as NAME_OF_ENTITY may be: PACMAN, FRUIT or GHOST. Any other type of entity will cause an exception and will terminate the program.
A special case may happen a fruit appears. Whenever a new fruit appears we receive:
FRUIT NUMBER_OF_FRUIT Y_POS_FRUIT X_POS_FRUIT| (Ex: FRUIT 9 1 2|)

Action sequence example: 
PACMAN DOWN|PACMAN RIGHT|GHOST LEFT|PACMAN LEFT|PACMAN RIGHT|GHOST LEFT|FRUIT 9 1 2|
PACMAN LEFT|PACMAN LEFT|GHOST RIGHT|FRUIT LEFT|

A screen's result file is formatted as follows:
Time of pacman death: TIMER_NUMBER
Screen finish time:TIMER_NUMBER

Example:
Time of pacman death: 302
Time of pacman death: 352
Screen finish time:477
